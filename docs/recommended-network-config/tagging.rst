Tagging
=======

AWS customers use tags to organize their EC2 resources (instances, images,
load balancers, security groups, and so forth), RDS resources
(DB instances, option groups, and more), VPC resources (gateways, option
sets, network ACLS, subnets, and the like), Route 53 health checks, and S3
buckets. Tags are used to label, collect, and organize resources and become
increasingly important as customers use AWS in larger and more sophisticated
ways.

For example, customers can tag relevant resources and then take advantage
:ref:`cost allocation via tagging <billing_tagging>`.
