.. Define |product name| in conf.py

If monitoring is provided for the product, document its use here.

- If an existing monitoring service is used, explain how it is used
  and provide a link to its documentation.
- If the product implements its own monitoring system, you might
  need to create many subtopics to explain that implementation.


For an example of a topic that describes how monitoring is
implemented for a product, see :ref:`monitoring-example-ug`.
