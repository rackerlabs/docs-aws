.. Define |product name| in ``conf.py``.

Provide information about the API for the product or service. If the API is
extensive, create a separate API reference document by using the
`API guide template <https://github.rackspace.com/IX/docs-starter-kit/tree/master/api-guide-template>`_.
Following is example introductory and reference text:

The |product name| API provides developers with HTTP methods to administer
the service.

The documentation for the |product name| API is located at <URL>.

If the API is not extensive and you want to document it here, group the
methods into logical categories, as needed, and then use the `HTTP request
template <https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-repo-template/blob/master/api-guide-template/api-reference/methods/http-request-template.rst>`_
to document the methods.
