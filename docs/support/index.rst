There are multiple ways to receive Fanatical Support for your AWS account(s).
A helpful Racker is always just a phone call or ticket away. We are
available live 24x7x365.

Tickets
-------

One of the primary ways that you can interact with a Racker is by creating
a ticket in the
`Fanatical Support for AWS Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.
Once logged in, click the Support button in the black bar at the top of the
screen and follow the links to create a new ticket or view an existing ticket.

Our automated systems will create tickets for events on your AWS account(s)
that require either your attention or the attention of a Racker. For example,
our :ref:`Rackspace Watchman <watchman>` will create a ticket when an alarm
is raised that requires attention.

Any time a ticket is updated, you will receive an email directing you back
to the Control Panel to view the latest comments.
