CloudHealth is the industry-leading cloud management platform that helps you easily
visualize cloud spend, quickly view cost savings opportunities and automate
cloud governance. Rackspace is the first CloudHealth partner to fully integrate
with their platform to include everything from account setup to user management. For
example, you can use single sign-on from the Rackspace portal into
CloudHealth. Users have full access to CloudHealth with near real-time
cost data, savings opportunities, inventory, and much more

CloudHealth is included in Platform Essentials, Navigator and Aviator for
all customers. Our Fanatical Support for AWS experts will work with you to:

* Review costs and savings potential

* Suggest tagging strategies to identify departmental owners for spend

* Configure reports for spend breakdown
