Service Levels
==============

Fanatical Support for AWS combines tooling and automation with human
experts to deliver a world-class experience. We offer two service levels,
Navigator and Aviator, which are selected for each AWS account we support.

* Navigator: "I want to do most things myself, but I want access to
  Rackspace's AWS experts and tools."
* Aviator: "I want Rackspace to operate and manage my AWS environments for
  me or with me."
