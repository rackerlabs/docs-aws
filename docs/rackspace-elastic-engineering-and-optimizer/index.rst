Advanced Monitoring and Resolution
-----------------------------------

Built for customers' critical workloads and always vigilant 24x7x365, our team
of operations engineers monitors and responds to alerts in customer
environments. Advanced Monitoring and Resolution (AMR) is an optionated
deployment of cloud services monitors that act as an extension of customer
operational teams by providing automation where possible and human actions for
activities that are beyond automation.

With Rackspace Technology acting as an extension of your 24x7 operational team,
you can focus on what matters most to your business.

AMR services
^^^^^^^^^^^^

AMR provides real-time monitoring and alerting for your cloud environment. An
expert team of operations engineers monitors and responds to any alerts in your
environment. Rackspace Technology has the breadth of knowledge required to
operate the most complex cloud deployments on a global scale. By combining with
the Rackspace Elastic Engineering service, you gain the peace of mind that comes
with having an environment cared for by a team of cloud-certified operations
engineers that help drive continuous innovation.

AMR includes:

- Optionated deployment of cloud services monitoring using known best-practices
- 24x7x365 monitoring coverage backed by cloud experts 
- Improved resolution timelines by leveraging Rackspace Technology automation 
- Guidance for a default list of alerts and thresholds, which we can customized to meet customer needs 
- On-going support to adjust monitoring as the customer environment grows

.. note::

  AMR requires :ref:`optimizer_plus` or :ref:`optimizer_platform` as a prerequisite.


.. _vm_management:

VM Management
-------------

VM Management (VMM) is a simple, full-featured tool that makes your most
critical and time-consuming server tasks easy to complete. Built to be
multi-cloud, VMM manages your VMs wherever they are located through a simple
interface and billed on a consolidated invoice. Set up your cloud the way you
want and then proceed with your migrations, transformations, and new development
activities.

VMM complements Rackspace Elastic Engineering by removing critical but
distracting workloads so you can focus your resources on building your
next-generation infrastructure.

Services
^^^^^^^^

VMM is currently in Limited Availability (LA). Descriptions of all services are
subject to change. In LA, VMM provides patching, and in subsequent releases, it
might include backup services for multi-cloud infrastructures. VMM also provides
the following services:

* Reporting
* Support
* API and UI access through the Rackspace Technology Control Panel

Patching
^^^^^^^^

VMM provides standard baseline patching. Customers can create custom patch
baselines, patch groups, and maintenance windows to adhere to their own patching
strategy. The API makes all of these services available for customization.

Best practices for each Operating System (OS) define the patch baselines, but we
customize them to fit customer needs.

In addition, customers can inject their own customization for patching to enable
process interruptions like reboots, non-standard package downloads, and so on.

Architecture Reviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rackspace Technology will provide, at your request, an architecture review in
accordance with the best practices in your cloud of choice.  We’ll evaluate your
security posture, technological architecture and use of cloud services among
other things.  At the end of that engagement, you’ll get a report you can use to
ensure your environment is compliant with best practice recommendations.


Planned Event Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Twice a year, Rackspace can help you to plan for and manage a large-scale event.
Commonly customers use this to help with events like Black Friday or their
“Shark Tank” moment.  We’ll evaluate your architecture, services utilized and
resiliency to help you form a strategy to withstand the sudden spike in visitors
to your application.


Basic VM Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of Optimizer+, we can setup a standard array of monitoring alerts for
your infrastructure based on the best practices of the cloud of your choice.
These alerts cover basic monitoring like instance performance checks, low disk
alerts and domain health.  While we don’t respond to these alerts when they
fire, we’ll gladly ensure they’re configured to flow to the support team of your
choice.

.. _optimizer_platform:

Optimizer+ with Platform Support
--------------------------------

following public cloud support services powered by certified Rackspace
Technology engineers and backed by top-level direct public cloud support.

Rackspace Technology can:

* Provide escalation management 24x7x365.
* Escalate issues at any time until we achieve resolution. This escalation might be
  hierarchical (to a more senior engineer or the service delivery manager) or functional
  (involving specialized technical expertise from other functional groups or partner cloud teams).
* Escalate to a technology or service vendor in the event of an incident.
* Offer advice about the appropriate workaround to restore service.
* Provide customers the opportunity to confirm issue resolution before closing the ticket.

We handle cloud platform escalations with the restoration of Services as the
