Waypoint
========

Waypoint is a tool that provides high-level, concise information about
costs, risks, and other key operational information associated with your
AWS accounts. By querying information from various APIs from both AWS and
Rackspace, it provides a consolidated view of key information. The goal
of Waypoint is to keep you informed about what's happening in your AWS
environments and to ensure we work together on improving your experience.

Waypoint is a near-real-time dashboard for the current month, and it also
provides historical reports for the previous 12 months, giving you both
current and trending information.

For the current month, cost data is updated approximately once per day.
Typically, by the tenth day of a month, we finalize the cost data for the
previous month (though the process may take a few days longer to run).

Users with access to all AWS accounts within a Rackspace account can access
Waypoint by clicking the Waypoint link in the
`Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.
Waypoint is available only to users with access to all AWS accounts because
it summarizes details for all those accounts.

Users with access to only a subset of all AWS accounts within a Rackspace
account can instead access Usage, which provides billing details for the
subset of accounts. To access Usage, click the Usage link in the
`Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.

Users will see either Waypoint (for those with access to all AWS accounts) or
Usage (for those with access to only some AWS accounts), but not both.
