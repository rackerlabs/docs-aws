Document the process of deploying (installing) your product. This
topic should document only the basic installation process; any
additional configuration should go in the Administering section.
Use steps, sub-steps, and procedures as needed. Show interim
example output if relevant.

Verification of installation success or trial operation is documented
in the ``verifying.rst`` file.

For an example of a topic that uses this template, see
:ref:`deploying-example-ug`.
